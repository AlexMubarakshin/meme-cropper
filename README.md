# twitter-screencap-cropper

Recognizes the text component and the image component of a meme. 

### Motivation: 
Instagram memes, which are just screencaps of Twitter posts, typically look like the following:

We may want to: 

1. Recognize what portion of the meme belongs to the text component.
2. Recognize what portion of the meme belongs to the image component.

Once we have partitioned the meme, we can save an image of each partition for later use.

### divide-screencap.py

Prompts user for an image:

~~~
$ python divide-screencap.py
Image to crop: sample_meme.jpg
~~~

Saves two images: *sample\_meme_text.jpg* and *sample\_meme_pic.jpg* to the working directory
