# twitter-screencap-cropper
Crops out the image from screencap of Twitter posts

### Motivation: 
Instagram post typically look like the following:

![](/Users/evanmartin/Desktop/twitter-screencap-cropper/sample_meme_optimal.jpg)

However, scraped images are usually less uniform in style:


![](/Users/evanmartin/Desktop/twitter-screencap-cropper/sample_meme_badborder.jpg)


![](/Users/evanmartin/Desktop/twitter-screencap-cropper/sample_meme_badfont.jpg)

which is bad if you want to repost these images and keep a neat-looking Instagram page

So we want a way to take an image scraped off another Instagram account and extract the image as well as the text, so that we may create a new Instagram post in the format we like. 

This script takes an Instagram post and extracts the Twiter pic image.
